I work at Huawei Technologies <img src='./images/huawei.jpg' style='width: 6em;'> as a research scientist now in Beijing. 

I am now working on language identification, machine translation and LLM Agent research. If you are seeking any form of **employment opportunity**, please feel free to email me at [dingjianbang1@huawei.com](mailto:dingjianbang1@huawei.com). We are also **hiring interns**!

I graduated from [School of Intelligence Science and Technology](https://sai.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), Peking University (北京大学智能学院) with a master's degree, advised by [Prof. Zhihong Deng (邓志鸿)](https://sai.pku.edu.cn/szdw/zzjs/dzh.htm) and from Qian Xuesen Class, Xidian University (西安电子科技大学钱学森班) with a bachelor's degree. I also collaborate with [Prof. Xu Sun (孙栩)](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1078/1673.htm) and [Dr. Yongxing Dai (戴永兴)](https://sikastar.github.io/) closely. 

I won [the CCL 2023 Best Poster Award](http://cips-cl.org/?p=87826) and the 2017 National Scholarship (Top 1%). My work was selected by the Xi'an Municipal Government for exhibition at [the 2017 Silk Road International Expo](https://www.beidouunion.com/kjzy/news_349.html) （2017丝绸之路国际博览会）.

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published 50+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. 

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the [MLNLP community](https://space.bilibili.com/168887299) in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee.
